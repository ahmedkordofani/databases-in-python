# Module 3: Databases

In Module 3 of the Makers course, I achieved significant milestones that have equipped me with crucial skills in database management and integration, making me well-prepared for a career as a software engineer:

1. **Database Schema Design and Creation:** I successfully designed a database schema with a minimum of two tables, including a one-to-many relationship between them, and implemented this schema in a database using SQL. This skill is fundamental for structuring and organizing data effectively.

2. **SQL Query Proficiency:** I learned to use SQL to query a database, read data from tables or results of joins, create new records, update existing data, and delete records. These capabilities allow me to interact with databases effectively and retrieve or modify data as needed.

3. **Database Integration with Programs:** I integrated a relational database with a program by test-driving classes that implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) methods to send SQL queries to the database. This ensures seamless interaction between the application and the database.

4. **Communication with Databases Explained:** I created sequence diagrams to explain how my program communicates with the database, demonstrating a clear understanding of the data flow and interactions between the application and the database.

The accomplishments in Module 3 have provided me with essential skills and experiences in database management, SQL querying, and program-database integration. These achievements demonstrate my readiness to work with databases and effectively contribute to software engineering projects that require seamless data management and integration.
